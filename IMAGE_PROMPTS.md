## Chapter 1: The Smooth World

### Image 1.1 — "The Perfect Zoom" concept
> A beautiful curve (like a sine wave or parabola) shown at three zoom levels side by side. Left panel: the full curve, clearly curved. Middle panel: zoomed in 10x, less curved. Right panel: zoomed in 1000x, perfectly straight, glowing in purple. Each panel is a clean rounded rectangle. Arrows connect them showing increasing magnification. The rightmost panel has a subtle purple glow around the straight line segment.

### Image 1.2 — "The Infinitesimal Cloud"
> A horizontal number line with tick marks at -2, -1, 0, 1, 2. Around the number 0, there is a soft, glowing, semi-transparent purple elliptical cloud. Inside the cloud, tiny points shimmer — these are the infinitesimals. The cloud is labeled "d² = 0" in elegant typography. Similar but smaller clouds appear around 1 and 2. Clean, mathematical, ethereal.

## Chapter 2: The Slope Equation

### Image 2.1 — "The Infinitesimal Triangle"
> A unit circle with a very small angle marked at the origin. A right triangle is formed with hypotenuse 1 (along the radius), a tiny vertical side labeled "sin(d) = d" in purple, and a horizontal base labeled "cos(d) = 1". The angle is labeled "d" in purple. The triangle is emphasized with a subtle purple fill. The rest of the unit circle is drawn in thin dark gray. Clean geometric illustration.

### Image 2.2 — "Function and Its Tangent"
> A smooth parabola (y = x²) drawn as a bold dark curve on a subtle grid. At the point (1, 1), a purple dashed tangent line touches the curve. A small purple dot marks the point of tangency. A tiny magnifying glass icon shows the infinitesimal neighborhood where the curve and tangent are identical. The purple tangent has a soft glow.

## Chapter 3: The Rules of Change

### Image 3.1 — "The Product Rule Rectangle"
> A rectangle subdivided into four regions, viewed from above. The main large rectangle is labeled "fg" in blue. The right strip is labeled "f·g'd" in green. The bottom strip is labeled "f'·g·d" in green. The tiny corner square is labeled "= 0" in red with a crossed-out effect (representing d² = 0). Dimensions are marked: width "f" and "f'd" (purple), height "g" and "g'd" (purple). Clean, geometric, like a textbook diagram.

---

## Chapter 4: Applications of Derivatives

### Image 4.1 — "Stationary Points"
> A smooth curve with a clear local maximum and local minimum. At each extremum, a small purple rectangle represents the infinitesimal neighborhood — it's perfectly flat (horizontal). Horizontal dashed purple lines show the flat tangent. Labels "max: f'=0" and "min: f'=0" in small elegant sans-serif. The curve is dark, the extrema highlights are purple.

### Image 4.2 — "The Farmer's Fence Problem"
> A bird's-eye view of a rectangular field with a fence around it. The sides are labeled "x" and "50−x". Inside, the area "A = x(50−x)" is shown. A subtle overlay shows the optimal square (x=25) glowing in purple. Clean, minimal, diagrammatic.

---

## Chapter 5: Integration

### Image 5.1 — "The Infinitesimal Strip"
> A smooth curve (like y = sin(x) + 1) with the area underneath shaded in light purple. At one point, a single infinitesimal strip is highlighted in bright blue — a thin rectangle. On top of the rectangle, a tiny triangle is shown in red/transparent, labeled "area = 0 (d² = 0)". The strip has labels: width "d" (purple), height "f(x)" (dark). X-axis labels show "x" and "x+d". Beautiful mathematical illustration.

### Image 5.2 — "The Fundamental Theorem Visualized"
> Split image: Left side shows a curve y=f(x) with accumulating shaded area from 0 to x. Right side shows the derivative function A'(x) which equals f(x). A flowing arrow connects them with the equation A'(x) = f(x). The visual metaphor: the height of the curve IS the rate of area accumulation.

## Chapter 6: Applications of Integration

### Image 6.1 — "Volume of Revolution"
> A 2D curve (like y = √x) shown on the left, with an arrow showing rotation around the x-axis. On the right, the resulting 3D solid of revolution is shown as a elegant 3D rendering with visible cross-section disks in purple. One infinitesimal disk is highlighted, labeled with radius "f(x)" and thickness "d". Soft lighting, clean 3D render.

### Image 6.2 — "Cylindrical Shell"
> A thin cylindrical shell highlighted in translucent purple, shown in 3D perspective. Labels show radius "x", height "f(x)", and thickness "d". The shell is part of a larger solid of revolution shown as a ghosted outline. Clean 3D illustration.

---

## Chapter 7: Taylor Series

### Image 7.1 — "The Taylor Telescope"
> A function curve (like e^x) with overlaid polynomial approximations of increasing degree. Degree 1 (tangent line) in light blue. Degree 2 (parabola) in green. Degree 3 (cubic) in orange. The original function in dark. Where each approximation matches the function perfectly, highlight that region with a purple glow labeled "exact on D_n". The polynomials "telescope" outward from the point of expansion.

---

## Chapter 8: Physics

### Image 8.1 — "Position, Velocity, Acceleration Chain"
> Three stacked panels showing a ball in motion. Top panel: position curve x(t) (smooth parabola). Middle panel: velocity curve v(t) = x'(t) (straight line). Bottom panel: acceleration a(t) = v'(t) (horizontal line, constant). Arrows labeled "d/dt" connect the panels. Each panel has a subtle background color. Clean, infographic style.

### Image 8.2 — "Kepler's Law: The Infinitesimal Sector"
> An elliptical orbit with a central point (the sun) and a particle. The radius vector sweeps an infinitesimal angle dθ. The swept area is shown as a triangle (not a sector — because of microstraightness) filled in light purple. Label: "area = ½r²dθ". Multiple equal-area triangles are shown at different points on the orbit, emphasizing "equal areas in equal times."

### Image 8.3 — "The Catenary"
> A chain hanging between two points, forming a perfect catenary curve. At one point, an infinitesimal segment is highlighted with force arrows: tension pointing along the curve on both sides, and weight pointing straight down. The force triangle is shown enlarged to the side. Elegant, technical illustration.

---

## Chapter 9: Many Dimensions

### Image 9.1 — "The Infinitesimal Cross D(2)"
> A smooth 3D surface (like a saddle or a hill) rendered in soft lighting. At one point on the surface, two infinitesimal vectors d₁ and d₂ emerge — one in blue, one in green — forming a small cross. They define the tangent plane at that point. The tangent plane is shown as a translucent purple square. Labels for partial derivatives ∂f/∂x and ∂f/∂y.

### Image 9.2 — "Gradient as Steepest Ascent"
> A topographic/contour map view of a surface (concentric elliptical level curves). At several points, gradient arrows point perpendicular to the level curves, in the direction of steepest ascent. The arrows are in purple, the contours in gray. Clean, map-like illustration.

---

## Chapter 10: Differential Forms

### Image 10.1 — "The Grand Unification"
> A central golden/purple glowing orb labeled "∫ dω = ∫ ω" (Stokes' Theorem). Four beams of light radiate outward to four smaller nodes: "FTC" (blue), "Green's" (green), "Stokes'" (orange), "Divergence" (red). Each node has a tiny icon representing its geometric context (interval, region, surface, volume). Celestial, grand, majestic — but still clean and mathematical.

### Image 10.2 — "Interior Cancellation"
> A grid of small squares tiled to fill a region. Each square has arrows on its edges showing the orientation of integration. Shared edges between adjacent squares show opposing arrows that cancel out (shown with an X or fade). Only the arrows on the outermost boundary survive, highlighted in purple. Elegant, tessellation-style illustration.
