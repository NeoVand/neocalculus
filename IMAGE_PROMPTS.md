## Chapter 1: The Smooth World

### Image 1.1 — "Smooth vs. Non-Smooth Comparison"
> Two panels side by side. Left panel: a smooth parabola (y = x²) with three zoom insets showing it progressively straightening out, the innermost perfectly straight with a purple glow. Right panel: an absolute value function (y = |x|) with three zoom insets showing the sharp corner persisting at every zoom level. Clean geometric illustration.

### Image 1.2 — "The Infinitesimal Cloud"
> A horizontal number line with tick marks at -2, -1, 0, 1, 2. Around the number 0, there is a soft, glowing, semi-transparent purple elliptical cloud. Inside the cloud, tiny points shimmer — these are the infinitesimals. The cloud is labeled "d² = 0" in elegant typography. Similar but smaller clouds appear around 1 and 2. Clean, mathematical, ethereal.

### Image 1.3 — "The Perfect Zoom" concept
> A beautiful curve (like a sine wave or parabola) shown at three zoom levels side by side. Left panel: the full curve, clearly curved. Middle panel: zoomed in 10x, less curved. Right panel: zoomed in 1000x, perfectly straight, glowing in purple. Each panel is a clean rounded rectangle. Arrows connect them showing increasing magnification.

### Image 1.4 — "Constructive Logic"
> A Venn-diagram-style illustration. A large circle labeled "Classical Logic" contains a smaller circle labeled "Constructive Logic." Outside the smaller circle but inside the larger, ghostly outlines of pathological objects (step functions, fractal curves) are shown fading away. Inside the constructive circle: smooth curves, gentle gradients.

## Chapter 2: The Slope Equation

### Image 2.1 — "The Infinitesimal Triangle"
> A unit circle with a very small angle marked at the origin. A right triangle is formed with hypotenuse 1 (along the radius), a tiny vertical side labeled "sin(d) = d" in purple, and a horizontal base labeled "cos(d) = 1". The angle is labeled "d" in purple. Clean geometric illustration.

### Image 2.2 — "Geometric Meaning of the Derivative"
> A smooth parabola (y = x²) with a point marked at (1, 1). A purple dashed tangent line touches the curve. Labels show: the point (x, f(x)), the nudged point (x+d, f(x+d)), and the slope f'(x). A magnifying glass inset shows the infinitesimal neighborhood where curve and tangent are identical.

### Image 2.3 — "Function and Derivative Side by Side"
> Split panel. Left: the graph of sin(x) as a bold dark curve. Right: the graph of cos(x) as a bold purple curve. Arrows between them labeled "differentiate →" and "← integrate". Where sin is increasing, cos is positive; where sin has a peak, cos crosses zero.

## Chapter 3: The Rules of Change

### Image 3.1 — "The Product Rule Rectangle"
> A rectangle subdivided into four regions, viewed from above. The main large rectangle is labeled "fg" in blue. The right strip is labeled "f·g'd" in green. The bottom strip is labeled "f'·g·d" in green. The tiny corner square is labeled "= 0" in red with a crossed-out effect (representing d² = 0). Clean, geometric.

### Image 3.2 — "The Chain Rule Pipeline"
> Two function machines in series, connected by a pipe. Input x enters the first machine (labeled g), output g(x) flows into the second machine (labeled f). At each stage, an infinitesimal nudge d is shown getting multiplied: d becomes g'(x)·d after the first machine, then f'(g(x))·g'(x)·d after the second.

### Image 3.3 — "Implicit Curve with Tangent"
> A circle x²+y²=1 drawn in dark gray. At the point (√2/2, √2/2), a purple tangent line is drawn. The slope -x/y is labeled. Alongside: the folium of Descartes x³+y³=6xy with its tangent at a marked point.

### Image 3.4 — "Concavity"
> A curve with a clear concave-up region (cup shape) and concave-down region (cap shape). In the concave-up region, the tangent line is drawn below the curve. In the concave-down region, the tangent is above. Labels: "f'' > 0" and "f'' < 0". An inflection point where curvature changes is marked with a dot.

## Chapter 4: Applications of Derivatives

### Image 4.1 — "Stationary Points"

> A cubic function f(x) = x³ - 3x + 2 with all features labeled: critical points, inflection point, increasing/decreasing intervals, concave up/down regions. Clean infographic with arrows and color coding.

### Image 4.3 — "Newton's Method"
> A curve with a root. At a starting point, a tangent line is drawn. Where the tangent crosses the x-axis, a vertical line goes up to the curve. A new tangent is drawn. The process converges to the root. Each iteration is shown in a lighter shade of purple.

### Image 4.4 — "Linear Approximation"
> A curve f(x) and its tangent line L(x) at a point a. As you move away from a, the gap between f and L grows. A shaded region shows the error, with label "error ∝ (Δx)²".

### Image 5.2 — "The Fundamental Theorem Visualized"
> Split image: Left shows a curve y=f(x) with accumulating shaded area from 0 to x. Right shows the derivative function A'(x) which equals f(x). A flowing arrow connects them with the equation A'(x) = f(x).

### Image 5.3 — "Area Between Curves"

## Chapter 10: Differential Forms

### Image 10.1 — "The Grand Unification"
> A central golden/purple glowing orb labeled "∫ dω = ∫ ω" (Stokes' Theorem). Four beams of light radiate outward to four nodes: "FTC", "Green's", "Stokes'", "Divergence". Each has a tiny geometric icon (interval, region, surface, volume).

### Image 10.2 — "Interior Cancellation"
> A grid of small squares tiled to fill a region. Each square has arrows on its edges showing integration orientation. Shared edges between adjacent squares show opposing arrows that cancel out. Only boundary arrows survive in purple.

### Image 10.3 — "1-Forms and 2-Forms"
> Two panels. Left: a 1-form visualized as a field of parallel lines (like a stack of pancakes) that a curve passes through — the integral counts crossings. Right: a 2-form as a density field — the integral measures total "stuff" in a region.

### Image 10.4 — "d² = 0: Two Faces"
> A split image. Left: the infinitesimal axiom d²=0 shown with a tiny segment whose square vanishes. Right: the exterior derivative d²ω=0 shown as a closed form with no boundary. A bridge connects them: "Same principle, different scales."
